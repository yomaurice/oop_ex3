In this assignment we were asked to basically "translate" our implementation of a directed weighted graph that we coded in in earlier assignments in java to python.
in addiation to the "translating", we also had a couple of new function to code like "connected component and connected components.
further more, an aditional part to this assignment was to use the python built-in library networx, and to compare the runtime between all three implamentation.
as it turns out, our implamentation could be more efficient...

any way, the wiki pages inside this project explain in further depths, but i will bring the summery here:
a graph is built mainlly from a dictionary of nodes, and a list of edges.
apart from a key, a position, a info elememnt and weight, every node has two dictionaries: one of neighbor nodes leading from him and one of neighbor nodes leading to him.
edges are built from source node, dest node, and weight.
now that we have a graph, we create a type that will allow us to execute different function on this graph.

in this assignment we used a built in python library to acctualy plot the graphs

from this assignment we learnt not only to plainly cole in python but also how to "think" in python. we saw first hand how efficient and user friendly it is and we can now trully compare it to java
